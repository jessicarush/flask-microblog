# Microblog

This is my own version of the microblog from Miguel Grinberg's amazing [Flask Mega Tutorial.](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).  

I've followed along with his tutorial pretty closely, the only exception being that I've excluded all the flask-bootstrap stuff from [chapter 11](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xi-facelift) as I prefer writing CSS on my own. A warning, the code here contains a tonne of comments, most of which come from Miguel's blog.
