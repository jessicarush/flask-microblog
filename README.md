# Microblog

This is my own version of the microblog from Miguel Grinberg's amazing [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).  If you're interested in learning Flask, Miguel's tutorial is the best you'll find on the web. I've followed along with the tutorial pretty closely, with the only exceptions being that I've excluded all the Bootstrap stuff from [chapter 11](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xi-facelift) as I prefer writing my own CSS. As a result, I also had to find an alternate solution to the popups described in [chapter 20](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xx-some-javascript-magic) as Miguel's solution uses Bootstrap. I integrated this [webui-popover](https://github.com/sandywalker/webui-popover) instead.
